# Data_Cleaning_and_Exploration_Using_Csvkit
In this project, we utitlized the Csvkit library, which supercharges your workflow by adding 13 new command line tools specifically for working with CSV files. We focused on below 5 tools from Csvkit:

- __csvstack__: for stacking rows from multiple CSV files.
- __csvlook__: renders CSV in pretty table format.
- __csvcut__: for selecting specific columns from a CSV file.
- __csvstat__: for calculating descriptive statistics for some or all columns.
- __csvgrep__: for filtering tabular data using specific criteria.

We used csvkit version 0.9.1 in this mission and you can read about the installation procedure in the [documentation](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.1/install.html). Furthermore, we worked with the 3 datasets on housing affordability which may be downloaded from below:

- `Hud_2005.csv` ===> [here](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/122/Hud_2005.csv).
